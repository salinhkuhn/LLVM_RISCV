# RiscvDialect

This repository contains early experimental code from my **BSc thesis**, where I implemented **code generation for the RISC-V processor** using the **Lean 4 theorem prover** and **functional programming language**.  

The final, production-quality code and proofs from the thesis have since been fully **upstreamed** into:

- the **Lean-MLIR** project  
- and a standalone repository containing the **RISC-V ISA semantic mechanization in Lean 4**

This repository remains as a historical snapshot of the initial prototyping work.
